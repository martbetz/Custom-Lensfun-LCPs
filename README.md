# Custom Lensfun LCPs #

All lenses ‚Äî _even the really expensive ones_ ‚Äî have their flaws; [Lensfun](https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun) is a fantastic project that helps compensate for these flaws using a generous and ever-growing collection of publically-contributed LCPs (lens-correction profiles).

### Why create custom LCPs? ###

Many of my older lenses, because of their obscurity and/or rarity, aren‚Äôt included in the Lensfun database (at least, not at the time of writing). Some of these lenses get used A LOT, so creating LCPs for them was an absolute must.

While most of my newer and more popular lenses _are_ included in the database,  the accuracy of the LCPs seemed to vary ‚Äî for example, the results I got from the Fujinon XC 35mm F2 LCP just didn't look right to me. üòû

### Why not submit them directly to Lensfun? ###

Many of my custom LCPs either contain geometric distortion data only or the remaining data has been copied from existing LCPs (I tend to lean on the built-in tools of [RawTherapee](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee) and [GIMP](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp) to correct for other abberations). Submitting incomplete LCPs would be very lazy and extremely sloppy.

It's never been my intention to replace existing LCPs ‚Äî 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder,' and suggesting that mine are 'better' in any way would be very naive and extremely rude; and while it's often nice to have a choice, submitting them as alternatives would only lead to confusion.

### What are the results like? ###

A [test run of my custom Fujinon XC 35mm F2 LCP](https://youtu.be/r3FstrYvvno) can be viewed on Youtube; I think it looks very nice indeed, but why not judge for yourself? üòç



### Great! But where are they? ###

I'll be uploading them to [github/martbetz/Custom-Lensfun-LCPs](https://github.com/martbetz/Custom-Lensfun-LCPs) very soon. Watch this space!
