# Custom Lensfun LCPs #

All lenses — _even the really expensive ones_ — have their flaws; [Lensfun](https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun) is a fantastic project that helps compensate for these flaws using a generous and ever-growing collection of publically-contributed LCPs (lens-correction profiles).

### Why create custom LCPs? ###

Due to their general obscurity, most of my older lenses aren’t included in the Lensfun database (at least, not at the time of writing). Some of these lenses get used _a lot_, so creating LCPs for them was a good investment.

While my newer and more popular lenses _are_ included in the database, I've found the accuracy of the LCPs to be somewhat hit and miss — results from the Fujinon XC 35mm F2 LCP, for example, just don't look right to me. 😞

### Why not submit them directly to Lensfun? ###

Most of my custom LCPs either contain geometric distortion data only or the remaining data has been copied from existing LCPs (I tend to lean on the built-in tools of [RawTherapee](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee) and [GIMP](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp) to correct for other abberations). Submitting incomplete LCPs would be very lazy and extremely sloppy.

More importantly, it's never been my intention to replace existing LCPs — 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder,' and suggesting that mine are 'better' in any way would be very naive and extremely rude; and while it's often nice to have a choice, submitting them as alternatives would only lead to confusion.

### What are the results like? ###

A [test run of my custom Fujinon XC 35mm F2 LCP](https://youtu.be/r3FstrYvvno) can be viewed on Youtube — I think it looks very nice indeed, but why not judge for yourself? 😍




(Please try to ignore the fact that I don't have any subscribers. 😆)

### Great! But where are they? ###

I'll be uploading them to [github/martbetz/Custom-Lensfun-LCPs](https://github.com/martbetz/Custom-Lensfun-LCPs) very soon. Watch this space!
