# Custom Lensfun LCPs #

### Why create custom LCPs? ###

[Lensfun](https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun) is a fantastic project, but I have quite a few lenses in my collection that aren't yet included in its ever-growing database. 

I've also found that some of the existing LCPs aren't quite to my liking — the _Fuji XC 35mm F2_ LCP, for example, just doesn't look right to me. 

### Why not submit them directly to Lensfun? ###

Due to the way I use Lensfun, many of my custom LCPs either contain geometric distortion data only or the remaining data has been copied from existing LCPs (I tend to lean on the built-in tools of [Raw Therapee](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee) to correct for other abberations). Submitting incomplete LCPs would be very lazy and extremely sloppy.

Furthermore, it's never been my intention to submit replacements for any existing LCPs — 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder,' and suggesting that my LCPs are in any way 'better' would be very naive and extremely rude! — and while it's often nice to have a choice, submitting them as alternatives would  soon lead to confusion.

### Great! So where are they?

I'll be uploading them very soon. Watch this space!
