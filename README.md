# Custom Lensfun LCPs #

### Why Create Custom LCPs? ###

[Lensfun](https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun) is a fantastic project, but I have quite a few lenses in my collection that aren't yet included in its ever-growing database. 

I've also found that some of the existing LCPs aren't quite to my liking — the Fuji XC 35mm F2 LCP, for example, just doesn't look quite right to me. 

### Why Not Submit These LCPs Directly to Lensfun? ###

Due to the way I use Lensfun, many of my custom LCPs either contain geometric distortion data only or the remaining data has been copied from existing LCPs (I tend to lean on the built-in tools of [Raw Therapee](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee) to correct for other abberations). Submitting incomplete LCPs would be both very lazy and extremely sloppy.

Submitting alternive versions of existing LCPs would obviously lead to confusion; needless to say, it would also be downright rude! — I don't consider my custom LCPs to be 'better' in any way; it's just that I consider them more aesthetically pleasing ('beauty,' as the saying goes 'is in the eye of the beholder').

### Great! So Where Are They?

I'll be uploading them very soon. Watch this space!
