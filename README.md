### What are Lensfun LCPs? ###

All lenses â€” _even the really expensive ones_ â€” have their flaws; Lensfun helps compensate for these flaws using a generous and ever-growing collection of project-approved LCPs (lens-correction profiles).

### Why create custom LCPs? ###

Due to their general obscurity, most of my older lenses arenâ€™t included in the [Lensfun](https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun) database (at least, not at the time of writing). Some of these lenses get used _a lot_, so creating LCPs for them was a good investment. 

While my newer and more popular lenses _are_ included in the database, I've found the accuracy of the LCPs to be somewhat hit and miss â€” results from the Fujinon XC 35mm F2 LCP, for example, just don't look right to me. ðŸ˜ž 

### Why not submit them directly to Lensfun? ###

Most of my custom LCPs either contain geometric distortion data only or the remaining data has been copied from existing LCPs (I tend to lean on the built-in tools of [RawTherapee](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee) and [GIMP](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp) to correct for other abberations). Submitting incomplete LCPs would be very lazy and extremely sloppy.Â¹

More importantly, it's never been my intention to submit _replacement_ LCPs â€” 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder,' and suggesting that mine are 'better' in any way would be very naive and extremely rude; and while it's often nice to have a choice, submitting them as _alternatives_ would only lead to confusion.Â²

### What are the results like? ###

A [test run of my custom Fujinon XC 35mm F2 LCP](https://youtu.be/r3FstrYvvno) can be viewed on Youtube â€” I think it looks very nice indeed, but why not judge for yourself?Â³ 



### Great! But where are they? ###

I'll be uploading them to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/martbetz/Custom-Lensfun-LCPs) very soon â€” watch this space!
