# Custom Lensfun LCPs #

All lenses ‚Äî _even the really expensive ones_ ‚Äî have their flaws. [Lensfun](https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun) includes a generous and ever-growing collection of user-contributed LCPs (lens-correction profiles), but I've also created a few of my own.

### Why create custom LCPs? ###

Lensfun is a fantastic project, but a lot of lenses from my collection aren't included in the project database (at least, not at the time of writing).

Also, some of the existing LCPs aren't quite to my liking ‚Äî for example, the [Fujinon XC 35mm F2](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/xc35mmf2/) LCP just doesn't look right to me. üòû

### Why not submit them directly to Lensfun? ###

Due to the way I use Lensfun, many of my custom LCPs either contain geometric distortion data only or the remaining data has been copied from existing LCPs (I tend to lean on the built-in tools of [RawTherapee](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee) and [GIMP](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp) to correct for other abberations). Submitting incomplete LCPs would be very lazy and extremely sloppy.

More importantly, it's never been my intention to submit replacements for any existing LCPs ‚Äî 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder,' and suggesting that my LCPs are in some way 'better' would be very naive and extremely rude; and while it's often nice to have a choice, submitting them as alternatives would only lead to confusion.

### What are the results like? ###

A [test run of my custom Fujinon XC 35mm F2 LCP](https://youtu.be/r3FstrYvvno) can be viewed on Youtube; I think it looks very nice indeed, but why not judge for yourself? üòç



### Great! But where are they? ###

I'll be uploading them to [github/martbetz/Custom-Lensfun-LCPs](https://github.com/martbetz/Custom-Lensfun-LCPs) very soon. Watch this space!
